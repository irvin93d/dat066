The first thing we did was to arrange meetings at specific dates. The first
two weeks consisted of planning. Our idea was to share ideas and make a solid
plan so we could split work between members. We made a schedule and decided
what needs to be done each week. 

To understand how the system could be built we drew several UML- and system
flow diagrams, this gave us good ideas how we could modularize the system. Due
to the architecture and platform constraint we choose to code in Python. The
choice to use Python comes with advantages. Python have several 
text-to-speech, character recognition and image processing libraries that are
well developed.
