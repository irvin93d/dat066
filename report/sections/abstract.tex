  The goal of this project is to to develop a system that is able to analyse 
  an image and extract any available text. It should also be able to save the
  text in a file and convert the text to speech, with an accuracy of at least
  60\%. The platform that is going to be used is Linux.

  The approach to reach the goal is agile programming with inspiration from
  Scrum. Cycles with the length of one week will be used and meetings will be
  arranged twice a week.
  
  The user is going to be able to capture an image with a graphical interface
  which shows live camera feed. Once the picture is captured it is analysed
  and if any text is found it is printed, it should also be converted to
  speech.

  Existing libraries in Python are used. OpenCV are used for image processing,
  Tesseract for character recognition and gTTS for text to speech conversion.
  The result is a functioning system with an character recognition accuracy of
  90-100\% for clear text.
