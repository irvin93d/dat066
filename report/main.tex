\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
Literacy, the ability to read, is a core skill in the modern, information age
that we live in. Unfortunately, many people around the world suffer from
illiteracy due to reasons such as visual impairment, learning disabilities or
a lack of opportunity. Providing a solution to this problem could prove
fruitful in incorporating these people into our society. However, such a
solution to the illiteracy problem could prove costly both from a fiscal and
resource perspective. Optical Character Recognition technology could be the
key to solving this problem at a low opportunity cost.
\subsection{Purpose}
In cooperation with Cybercom, a software is to be developed which recognises
characters from an image and outputs it as an audio recording.
\subsection{Vision}
The vision of the final product is to have a smartphone application which
works on both Android and Appleâ€™s iOS. The product should support both video
feeds and static images as input and both text and audio outputs. In addition
to character recognition, word recognition and the ability to self-correct in
case of false recognition should be implemented. The recognition rate of all
the above features should match the industry standard of 95\%.

\subsection{Scope}
Due to time constraints word recognition and word correction features will not
 be implemented. The application will run on a laptop and not be ported to
 smartphones. The input will be in the form of still images and not a video
 feed. The industry standard 95\% recognition rate is also unachievable with
 the current time constraints and is instead adjusted to a 60\% recognition
 rate.

Features below are denoted with RF for required features and OF for optional
features.
  \noindent\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{X p{0.75\linewidth}}
  \toprule
    \textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Description} \\
  \midrule
  RF-1 &
    From an image, recognize characters with an accuracy of at least 60\%. \\
  RF-2 &
    Turn text into English speech output. \\
  RF-3 &
    User interface that implements RF-1 and RF-2. \\
  OF-1 &
    Add functionality and improve performance to make the product compatible
    with mobile devices. \textit{TBD} \\
  OF-2 &
    Use dictionary for correction of recognized words. \textit{TBD} \\
  OF-3 &
    Improve RF-1 to 90\% recognition rate. \\
